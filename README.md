# Practice Repository for learning git

This repository is for learning the use of Git and Github. Hacktoberfest is around, and you can use this repository to practice how to create a pull request, and learn about Version Control Systems. Let's begin the journey of open soure contributions by doing small contributions.

If you are not familiar with Git, you can learn about the same through YouTube. I recently discussed the same with [*@samarthraj11*](https://github.com/samarthraj11) in a live stream. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OFkVygsD9w)

Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md to get started with contributions.
